== Deployment

=== Important notes

In order to deploy you need to get access to the `apt_auth.conf` file that contains credentials used to access the apt repository on nexus.

It is available on AWS Parameter Store under `/secret/songpark/apt_auth.conf`

If you don't have access to AWS Parameter Store, ask to get the file from someone who does.

Once you have it, place it in the root of the project.
